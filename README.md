## Gamifying Flashcards

An education based application that allows users to **create flashcards and play 
games** that would help them recall their flashcards in a more enjoyable way. 
Users can build their own deck of flashcards (i.e. listing glossary terms) and 
play a game where they can collect points based on their results. The goal of the
game is for the users to answer the given question as written on the flashcard
before they reach the boundary. 

### Why study using flashcards?

Flashcards are a form of learning that engages our *active recall*. It improves
our memory retention and helps us build connections with the material.
It is also useful for visual learners like myself or students who have a short 
retention span and have a hard time reading long texts. By implementing flashcards 
as a rewarding game, it will also build the competitive spirit within the user 
and make learning more fun.

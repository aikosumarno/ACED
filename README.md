## Your Flashcard Learning Tool

An education based application that allows users to **create flashcards and 
improve their memory recall**. Users can build their own deck of flashcards 
(i.e. listing glossary terms) and track their study progress. The goal of 
the application is to provide users with a platform to store and study their 
flashcard easily. 

### Why study using flashcards?

Flashcards are a form of learning that engages our **active recall**. It improves
our *memory retention* and helps us *build connections* with the material.
It is also useful for *visual learners* like myself or students who have a short 
retention span and have a hard time reading long texts. By implementing flashcards 
as a rewarding game, it will also build the competitive spirit within the user 
and make learning more fun.
